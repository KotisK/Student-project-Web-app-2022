Graduate Stduents' Thesis (Kaldellis et al.) - Web app for informing disable people on cultural events (sign language, chatbot, TTS-STT)

The aim of this project is to create an application that informs Persons with Disabilities (PWD) about cultural events. The cultural events are stored in an SQL database and retrieved according to the user's queries. For the search, retrieval and presentation of the events there is a specific vocabulary, formulated with appropriate questions in order for the user to have a clear picture about the information collected. This information is provided in the form of text, audio and video. In addition, for the efficient communication between the user and the application, the Greek sign language recognition model and a chatbot are provided, which answer questions related to the Where? When? and What? of cultural events. The outcome of this project is the development of a Web-based application that supports PWD to be informed about cultural events in Greece.

Keywords: PWD, Cultural Events, Sign Language, Chatbot.
